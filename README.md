# Conferences Calendar

This repository hosts the conferences calendar website (https://conferences.wodiany.me), as well as, scripts and data used to build it.

## Build

To build the website first install Python and NPM on your machine (tested with Python 3.10.2 and NPM 8.3.1), and then simply run:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will take the list of conferences in `data/` and HTML + CSS templates in `templates/`, and generate the website files in `docs/` directory.

## Credits

This website was designed and build by Igor (https://wodiany.me) with an invaluable input from Nick (http://nkyparissas.me), Kostas (https://iordanouki.github.io) and Ruiqi (https://linkedin.com/in/ruiqi-ye-139482147/).
